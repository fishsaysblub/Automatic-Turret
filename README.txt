The project started a turret game where the player had to destroy a castle while standing still,
although that soon changed to what it is now. I prefer creating AI and continue to prioritize that over normal games. 
It isn’t my prettiest work but it will do, since then I’ve improved quite a bit in how I write my code.

The main script is the AI_TurretController.cs, basically all of the movement and shooting happens in there.

This was the first time I’ve used the state machine and observer pattern for a game,
it took quite a while to find out how they worked but I managed to get it working and understand how it works.
Since this project I’ve used the state machine a lot more times and actually really like working with them.
The observer pattern definitely was harder to get used to. I really like the way it works and think I should use it more than I do at the moment.
